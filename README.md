# Empirical re-analysis of sampling strategies in decisions from experience.
# Abstract
How do we decide has been a longstanding subject of research. Despite the notable works in this field, the impact of information search process had been often overlooked until recent years. Hills and Hertwig (2010) examined the interplay between search and choice behavior and discovered novel findings. Nevertheless, their study leaves room for enhancement, particularly in utilizing more extensive datasets and refining measurement accuracy
This paper seeks a deeper look into the relationship between search and decision strategies through empirical analysis, leveraging an extensive data set prepared by Wulff. et al (2018). Unlike previous studies, it also integrates the effect of experienced choice ecology into the analysis. The analysis demonstrates that when different decision strategies predict the same option as a winner, the effect of search behavior on the maximization rates changes significantly.
